Summary: New release adds metadata copy support, fixes 4 bugs. 
ShortVersion: 3.4.3

# Resizer 3.4.3 - May 8 2014

This release introduces [the CopyMetadata plugin](/plugins/copymetadata), and the [DiagnosticJson plugin](/plugins/diagnosticjson).

Please read the [3.4.0 release notes for very important guidance and upgrade instructions](/releases/3-4-0).


## New plugins

* The [CopyMetadata plugin](/plugins/copymetadata), when installed, allows you to copy all metadata from the source image to the destination image with `&copymetadata=true`.
* The [DiagnosticJson plugin](/plugins/diagnosticjson) allows for remote debugging of layout and rendering issues by providing the execution plan in json form. Extremely useful for unit testing.

## Fixed bugs

* AzureReader2 now works with 404Plugin. Fixes [bug #28](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/28).
* `scale=down` is now always respected, even when `mode=crop` is used. Fixes [bug #12](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/12).
* File streams returned by the RemoteReader plugin are now always seekable. Fixes [bug #26](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/26).
* For performance, the Watermark plugin will prefetch overlays prior to the actual render stage. This will prevent I/O blocking during rendering phases where high RAM consumption is required. Fixes [bug #69](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/69).

## New features in existing plugins

* Add named connection string support to AzureReader2. Fixes [bug #40](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/40)
* Watermark plugin now offers a 'defaultImageQuery' Web.config setting that can be used to simplify common overlay queries like `scache=true`. Fixes [#21](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/issues/21).

## API warnings

* protected methods ImageBuilder.buildToStream and ImageBuilder.buildToBitmap methods are obsolete and will be removed in V4. There are no known usages of these methods outside the core.

## No known remaining bugs
