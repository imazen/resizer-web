# Resizer 4.0.5 - Jan-31-2016

## Bug Fixes

* Bound manual crop rectangle *after* rounding, as values could be rounded up out of the canvas boundaries.  Fix PolygonMath.ToRectangle - round x2,y2 instead of rounding width/height. Avoids turning (0.5,0.5,2.5,2.5) into (1,1,4,4), creates (1,1,3,3) instead, now. Add regression test for manual crop rounding (as it affects FastScaling)

* Fix: CYMK jpegs with non-standard DPI (!=96) can be improperly cropped when FastScaling is in use. Graphics.DrawImageUnscaled actually scales based on DPI metadata.

* SqlReader should now treat a null blob value as a 404 - filenotfound
