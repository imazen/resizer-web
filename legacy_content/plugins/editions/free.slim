h1 Essential edition

markdown:


  Except for PdfRenderer, which is [under a different license](/licenses/pdfrenderer) due to its use of (A)GPL components, all of the plugins in this edition are released under the [Freedom license](/licenses/freedom) (for v3) or the [Apache license](/licenes/apache) for v4.

  Everything here can be found in the [free download](/download).

  Logging, MvcRoutingShim, and PdfRenderer are separate DLLs (due to extra dependencies), but all the rest are found in `ImageResizer.dll` in the `ImageResizer.Plugins.Basic` namespace.
