# Imazen Contributor Agreement

*This contribution agreement grants us non-exclusive copyright and patent licenses to your contributions, and absolves you of warranty obligations. It is based on the Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement.*

When contributing source code to any Imazen project, your contributions must be accompanied by the following statement (either via e-mail or (preferably) in the commit message):

    I release these contributions under the terms of the Imazen Contributor Agreement V1.0 
    (http://imageresizing.net/licenses/contribute), the terms of which I accept and agree.
    - [Name] [Date]



This contribution agreement is identical to the *Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement V2.0* found at [apache.org/licenses](http://www.apache.org/licenses/), except for the following changes:

1. Your agreement is with Imazen LLC, not the Apache Software Foundation, and the term "the Foundation" has been replaced with "the Managing Organization".
2. The license preface has been shortened and the requirement for a physical signature has been removed.
3. The fields for a physical copy have been moved to the bottom of the page.
4. You may opt-out of this agreement for future contributions through an explicit statement, although your contributions will not be accepted.

## Imazen Contributor Agreement v1.0

Imazen Contributor Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0

### License Preface

Thank you for your interest in open-source software. 

In order to clarify the intellectual property license
granted with Contributions from any person or entity, we must have digital
or physical evidence that each Contributor has agreed to the license terms below.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as
well as the protection of the Managing Organization and its users. It does not
change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
present and future Contributions submitted to the Managing Organization, 
UNLESS you explicitly state otherwise when making future contributions.  You acknowledge, however,
that we will be unable to accept Your Contributions if they are not provided under this agreement.

Except for the license granted herein to the Managing Organization and recipients of
software distributed by the Managing Organization, You reserve all right, title,
and interest in and to Your Contributions.

### License

1. Definitions.

   * "The Managing Organization" shall mean "Imazen LLC".

   * "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
   authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement
   with the Managing Organization. For legal entities, the entity making a
   Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled
   by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to
   be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition,
   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   * "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship,
   including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is intentionally submitted by You to the Managing Organization for inclusion
   in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by
   the Managing Organization (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition,
   "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
   communication sent to the Managing Organization or its representatives,
   including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing
   lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that
   are managed by, or on behalf of, the Managing Organization for the purpose of
   discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that
   is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You
   as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Managing Organization and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Managing Organization a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your
   Contributions and such derivative works.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Managing Organization and to
   recipients of software distributed by the Managing Organization a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
   made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the
   Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
   licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any
   entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity
   (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
   that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed,
   constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
   patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
   that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such
   litigation is filed.

4. You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above
   license. **If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property
   that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent
   that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf
   of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for
   your Contributions to the Managing Organization, or that your employer has
   executed a separate [Corporate CLA with the Managing Organization](/licenses/contribute-corp).**

5. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original
   creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).  You
   represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete
   details of any third-party license or other restriction (including,
   but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you
   are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your
   Contributions.

6. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions,
   except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide
   support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by
   applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your
   Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
   OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without
   limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-
   INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation,
   You may submit it to the Managing Organization separately from any
   Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of
   any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
   related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you
   are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as
   "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify the Managing Organization of any facts or circumstances of
   which you become aware that would make these representations
   inaccurate in any respect.
