# Introducing ImageResizer Editions


After Feb. 1st, 2013, you will only be able to purchase plugins as part of an [ImageResizer edition](/buy); we will be retiring the [plugin bundles](/plugins/bundles). We are not discontinuing any plugins, just changing the way they are packaged to reduce confusion and lower the barrier to entry. Existing bundle licenses are still valid, and you can [continue to purchase ImageResizer under the old pricing model until Feb. 1st, 2013](/plugins/bundles).

License keys will be introduced this year, but only once we have made them as painless as possible.

To clarify - the software does not yet have license keys, but they will be introduced within a few months for Performance and Creative Edition customers. Existing owners of a 'bundle' license, Elite, and Support Contract customers will be able to download DRM-free dlls. Also, the software *will* remain open-source, meaning you're welcome to remove the licensing code if you so desire.

## What is changing?

1. The Performance and Cloud Bundles will be merged into the $249/domain *Performance Edition* (Previously this would have cost $498/enterprise.)
2. The Design Bundle will become the $499/domain *Creative Edition*, and will also include everything from the *Performance Edition* (Previously $747/enterprise.)
3. We're introducing the *Elite Edition*, which includes absolutely all plugins currently offered, for $849/enterprise (versus $1,000/enterprise for all 4 bundles). 
4. Due to excessive business abuse of the Personal tier, it will be retired on Feb. 1 2013.
5. The Bronze 6-month will increase $49 from $900 to $949.
6. Only the *Performance* and *Creative* Editions will eventually require registration keys. We will make this experience as painless as possible. OpenID will be available, so you won't need a separate username and password for license management. 
7. None of the editions will include priority telephone or team-viewer support incidents, as they were not used effectively by customers when they were included with the Bundles. 
8. Bug-related support is still free, as always.
9. We will continue to include source code for everything, permit modification, accept patches, and allow limited redistribution to other license holders.
