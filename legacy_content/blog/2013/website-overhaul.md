# Redesigned website

After transitioning to [HardwiredCMS](http://hardwiredcms.com), we began extensive updates across all of our documentation pages to make information more easily accessible and less confusing.

We've created many new areas and rewritten others from scratch. Some new pages you might be interested in:

* [Community Portal](/docs/community)
* [Compatibility Portal](/docs/workswith)
* [Showcase](/docs/benefits/comprehensive)


* Pages for many major CMSes, so we can track compatibility and share tips & articles.
