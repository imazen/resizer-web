#ImageResizer Professional Client License v1.1

## Summary - For Clients

This license allows limited use of the ImageResizer plugins which you have received as part of a custom software solution from the Provider.

This license only permits as-is usage of the software and modification of configuration values.

These plugins are usually distributed as dlls, and are named ImageResizer.Plugins.[PluginName].dll.

For this license to be valid, the provider of your software must have a valid Enterprise, Professional, or OEM license for *all* of the plugins you have received, and you must be a client of the Provider (not an anonymous or 'free' user of their software). Also, except for OEM Providers, you may only get this license as part of a custom software development contract with the Provider.

See http://imageresizing.net/licenses/proclient for the latest version of this license. You may choose to either abide by the latest version of the license, or the version you were provided by the Provider - If they provided you a valid version. 

You can purchase a full license at http://imageresizing.net/ for a very reasonable cost, which frees you from the restrictions contained in this license.

## Summary - For Providers

As a holder of a [Pro][pro], [Enterprise][enterprise], or [OEM][oem] license, you may grant this license to a paying Client, which allows the Client to use the Software as part of a larger piece of software.

This permits a developer or business to integrate the Software on behalf of a Client, without the need for the client to purchase an additional license. The developer may provide both source code and binaries to the Client.

The Provider must include [a plain-text copy of this license](/attachments/client-license.txt) with the Project provided to the client, and should also communicate to the client the restrictions inherent in this license.

This license is very restrictive, but the Client can always purchase a full license at http://imageresizing.net/ for a very reasonable fee if the Client needs to perform in-house development with the Software. The Client may also use the software indefinitely for testing purposes under the [Trial][trial] license.

##License terms

Copyright (c) 2012 Imazen

### Definitions

* The "Client" is the individual or entity being granted this license (generally the reader).
* The "Software" is the source code and binaries authored by Imazen, which are being sub-licensed by the Provider to the Client.
* The "Project" is the larger piece of software (such as a CMS) which contains the Software, and is being licensed by the Provider to the client.
* The "Provider" is the individual or entity sub-licensing the Software to the Client under this license as part of the Project.
* An "Unethical Derivative Work" is a Project which competes with Imazen software that already existed at the original time of the Project's publication, yet uses Imazen software to achieve that goal. 


### How this license is granted

A holder of a [Professional][pro], [Enterprise][enterprise], or [OEM][oem] license (the Provider) may grant the Client the Professional Client license (this license), which allows the Client to use the Software as part of a larger piece of software (the Project) provided by the Provider. This license cannot be transferred once granted.

#### Restrictions on license grant

* The "Client" may not be anonymous to the Provider - there must exist proof that the Client has purchased the Project from the Provider. 
* Providers holding a Professional or Enterprise license may only grant this license to Clients as part of a bespoke (custom software) contract. 
* Providers holding an OEM license may grant this license to a Client as part of a paid license for the Project, as long as the Project falls within the scope restriction of their OEM license. 
* Sale, public distribution, marketing, and publishing of Unethical Derivative Works is prohibited. An example prohibited action would be selling a derived version of the ImageResizer which included a disk caching plugin (since that behavior is provided by an pre-existing plugin). If you are the 'first to market', however, you do not have to worry about retroactively being in violation of the license. To comply with this clause, compare the purpose of your derived product 
to the purpose of each of the products offered on <http://imageresizing.net/> and <http://imazen.io>.
If the purpose or marketing of the products are similar, then you should contact 
support@imazen.io for written clarification and permission (provided free of charge, if applicable).

### Rights granted by the license

The Client is granted the following rights:

 * Usage on an unlimited number of virtual or physical machines machines operated and either owned, rented, or licensed by the license holder. For example, this includes qualifying shared hosting plans, EC2 instances, dedicated co-located servers, development machines, or test servers. **Usage means use, not installation!**. This does not grant a hosting provider the rights to install the software for use by all customers, nor provide the right to *resell* usage of the software (I.E, a SaaS offering). Custom contracts for SaaS offerings, hosting providers, and CMSes are available, however - just email support@imazen.io.
 * Modification of configuration settings related to the Software.

The Client is prohibited from:

 * Using the Software except as part the Project provided by the Provider.
 * Modifying the way in which the Software is integrated with the Project.
 * Using or integrating the Software with another project or web site.
 * Extracting the Software from the Project.
 * Redistributing the Software outside the Client organization.
 * Modifying the Software.

All of the above restrictions are lifted with a Professional, Enterprise, or OEM license, which can be purchased for a reasonable fee.
If the Client purchases a more permissive license, they will be subject to those terms instead, and this license will become null and void.

All rights are reserved unless explicitly specified. This license is only valid when and if the Provider holds a valid, qualifying license for *all* plugins provided to the Client.
