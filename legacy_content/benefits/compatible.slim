h1 Blissfully compatible with practically everything

.well
  markdown:
    ### Remember, ImageResizer is a web service, which means you can always [run it in standalone mode](/docs/install/standalone) if embedded mode isn't an option. Embedded mode means running in-process, inside an existing ASP.NET application (the most popular scenario).

    ImageResizer v3 is compatible with Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Mono; it uses .NET 2.0. ImageResizer v4 requires .NET 4.5.

        ImageResizer offers a simple API for connecting to arbitrary datastores based on virtual paths. 

        At this time, there are no known datastores that are incompatible with the image resizer, although some may require a plugin to access. If you have a datastore not listed here, [read about custom plugin development](/plugins/custom)

      Any true CDN (true CDNs support origin-pull) is compatible with ImageResizer. Be sure to enable querystring preservation, or use ImageResizer's semicolon syntax instead.

      Rackspace Cloud Files is *not* a CDN. If you'd like them to *become* one, you [can vote for custom origin support here](http://feedback.rackspace.com/forums/71021-product-feedback/suggestions/1105435-add-the-origin-pull-feature-to-cloud-files).
