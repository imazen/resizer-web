# WIC Plugins (V3.1+)

ImageResizer.Plugins.Wic.dll contains 3 plugins: WicImageDecoder, WicImageEncoder, and WicImageBuilder.

These plugins require Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 for best performance and correct behavior.

Vista or Windows Server 2008 with the Platform Update applied should also work.

## Installation

1. Either run `Install-Package ImageResizer.Plugins.Wic` in the NuGet package manager, or add ImageResizer.Plugins.Wic.dll to your project
2. Add `<add name="WicDecoder" />` inside the `<plugins>` section of Web.config.
3. Add `<add name="WicEncoder" />` inside the `<plugins>` section of Web.config.
4. Add `<add name="WicBuilder" />` inside the `<plugins>` section of Web.config.
