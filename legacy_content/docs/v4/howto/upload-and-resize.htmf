<h2>Convert and Resize Images as They Are Uploaded</h2>

<p>Resizing and processing images as they are uploaded is very straightforward. Most of the required code is about paths and directories.</p>

<p>The following sample code generates a GUID filename for each upload, determines the appropriate file extension that is needed, then resizes/crops/formats the image according to the specified ResizeSettings.</p>

<pre lang="c#"><code>  //Loop through each uploaded file
  foreach (string fileKey in HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.Keys) 
  {
    HttpPostedFile file = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files[fileKey];
    if (file.ContentLength &lt;= 0) continue; //Skip unused file controls.

    //The resizing settings can specify any of 30 commands.. See http://imageresizing.net for details.
    //Destination paths can have variables like &lt;guid&gt; and &lt;ext&gt;, or 
    //even a santizied version of the original filename, like &lt;filename:A-Za-z0-9&gt;
    ImageResizer.ImageJob i = new ImageResizer.ImageJob(file, "~/uploads/&lt;guid&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;", new ImageResizer.ResizeSettings( 
                "width=2000;height=2000;format=jpg;mode=max"));
    i.CreateParentDirectory = true; //Auto-create the uploads directory.
    i.Build();
  }
</code></pre>

<h4>For VB.NET Users</h4>

<pre lang="vbnet"><code>  'Loop through each uploaded file
  For Each fileKey As String In HttpContext.Current.Request.Files.Keys
      Dim file As HttpPostedFile = HttpContext.Current.Request.Files(fileKey)
      If (file.ContentLength &gt; 0) Then 'Skip unused file controls.
        'The resizing settings can specify any of 30 commands.. See http://imageresizing.net for details.
        'Destination paths can have variables like &lt;guid&gt; and &lt;ext&gt;, or 
        'even a santizied version of the original filename, like &lt;filename:A-Za-z0-9&gt;
        Dim i As ImageResizer.ImageJob = New ImageResizer.ImageJob(file, "~/uploads/&lt;guid&gt;.&lt;ext&gt;", New ImageResizer.ResizeSettings("width=2000;height=2000;format=jpg;mode=max"))
        i.CreateParentDirectory = True 'Auto-create the uploads directory.
        i.Build()
      End If
  Next
</code></pre>
