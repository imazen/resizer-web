# ImageResizer v2

ImageResizer v2 is deprecated. To upgrade to v4, first follow the [migration guide for v2-> v3](/docs/v2/2to3/guide), then upgrade your binaries to v4 (which is backwards compatible). 


The original [product page](http://www.nathanaeljones.com/blog/2009/server-side-image-resizing-module-for-asp-net-asp-phpiis-3) can be seen here, but [the changelog is probably more useful](/docs/v2/changelog).
