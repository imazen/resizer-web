# Support contracts

Save money with a support contract. All contracts include permanent licenses to the latest version of all plugins offered when the contract expires. And even better - you get a direct line to the author. Don't hesitate to email `sales@imageresizing.net` about a customized support contract!

If you already purchased an Enterprise or Elite license, you can apply 50% of the purchase cost to a new support contract. 

### Go Bronze ($1000/yr with 2YR plan)

* The Bronze 6-month contract only costs $100 more than purchasing the Elite edition, and includes everything offered by Elite. It also includes 6 support incidents (limited to 1 per month) (normally $135 each), 2 assisted installs, 1 30-minute Q & A session (normally $190), and 1 hour of coding assistance (normally $195). That's $1195 in support savings, plus $100 savings on licensing. 
* The Bronze 1-year contract will save you $500 if V4 arrives within 1 year (which is likely), because it includes major version upgrades. It also includes $2,005 in support savings, and potentially $500 over the licensing model. 

### Go Silver ($4000/yr with 2YR plan)

The Silver plans (unlike Bronze) allow *any* employee of the business to get direct, unlimited phone & TeamViewer support. No need to funnel all questions through the designated employee. Also, you get a special e-mail address to contact support, with 2 business-hour response times guaranteed. Hot-fixes are guaranteed within seven days for blocking bugs. In addition, two hours of architecture planning with the author is included, as well as 3 hours of his coding time if you need some custom work. 5 assisted installs per year are included.

### Go Gold  ($8500/yr with 2YR plan)

The Gold plans are ideal for mission-critical scenarios and large enterprises. Hot-fixes are provided within 2 business days. 10 hours of custom coding per year is included, as well as 5 hours of architecture planning and 10 assisted installations.

### Medium-size print

* Support contracts begin the day payment clears.
* If your support contract cannot be honored because too few contracts were purchased in the given year to sustain development, you will get a full refund of your contract price (if it is a 1 year or shorter contract). If this happens on the second year, you will get a refund for 1/2 the purchase price. Due to growth patterns, it is extremely unlikely that this situation will occur.
* Please note - the Bronze support tier requires all support go through a single designated employee at your company, unlike the Silver and Gold tiers.
