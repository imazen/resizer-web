# Architecture advice and assisted installation

Developing a future-proof image management system isn't easy. A multitude of pitfalls and hidden costs exist, and nearly all the sample code and articles you'll find online will lead you straight into them. 

I've helped hundreds of enterprises achieve their scalability and performance goals, and it's much less expensive to avoid architectural errors before they're implemented.

For tech details about some of the challenges, [listen to my podcast with Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselminutes.com/313/deep-inside-image-resizing-and-scaling-with-aspnet-and-iis-with-imageresizingnet-author-na).

It's best to purchase the session a day before you'd like to schedule it, so we can choose a time that is optimal for everyone.
