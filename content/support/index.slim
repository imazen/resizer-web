		h2 Priority Support
		markdown:
			Priority email, phone and TeamViewer support costs $135/incident. A [30-minute Q&A session costs $70](/support/consult), but (unlike) a support incident, is time-limited and only reccommended for consulting/introduction purposes.

			If you work for a business, please [look at the support contract options](/support/contracts) - they can provide significant savings. 

			It is suggested that you download and install [Team Viewer](http://teamviewer.com) on the computer in question, as remote desktop access may be required to resolve your issue.

			Credit cards, PayPal, and Google Checkout are accepted.
