      We designed ImageResizer to be as easy to debug as possible. Try visiting the [self-diagnostics page](/plugins/diagnostics) on your server: `/resizer.debug.ashx`. Then you might try enabling [detailed error messages, and visiting the image URL directly](/docs/geterror).

      Having trouble? Check out our guides on [how to view the diagnostics page](/plugins/diagnostics) and [how to enable detailed error messages](/docs/geterror).

        The more specific you are, the more likely your problem will be diagnosted quickly. **Here is what we absolutely need before we can help you.**

        #### *StackOverflow*

        1. Your question must carry the ["ImageResizer" tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer) so we can find it.
        2. The question [includes a gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the diagnostics page output.
        3. The question is about the URL API and [follows best practices](/docs/best-practices).
        4. The question is detailed enough to answer and shows some diagnostic effort (Just "It's not working" probably won't get you the answer you need)
