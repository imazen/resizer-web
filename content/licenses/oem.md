# ImageResizer OEM license v2.0

The [OEM][oem] and [SaaS][saas] licenses are included with an [OEM, Silver, or Gold support contract](/support/contracts/compare). 

This is not the only license available. We offer [enterprise-wide][enterprise], [domain][domain], and [SaaS][saas] licenses for [immediate purchase](/licenses). ImageResizer V4 and later may also be used under the terms of the [AGPL 3.0][agpl]. Portions of ImageResizer V4 may be used under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0][apache]. For development and testing, you may use the software under the terms of the [Trial license][trial].


### Summary

If you wish to sell or distribute a product which contains ImageResizer plugins, this is the license you need.

This license is very similar to the [Enterprise license][enterprise], but does not restrict redistribution and sub-licensing to bespoke, custom software.

### Example Scope Agreement

To be valid, this license must be combined with a scope agreement, which may restrict resale to a particular application line or category, and will specify which plugins and plugin versions are included. 

Design and approval of a scope agreement is completely at our discretion. Please contact support@imageresizing.net to discuss your specific scope needs *prior* to checkout. 


    This OEM License is granted to "Fictional Acme Corporation" under the following Scope Agreement:

    OEM Scope Agreement between Fictional Acme Corporation and Imazen LLC
    
    1. Major releases of the Work will be included as long as the support 
       contract remains active. New software present in major releases may
       require a newer revision of the OEM license to be used, which may (in
       some cases) require that updated license terms be distributed to 
       third parties with the new version. Any subsequent minor updates to 
       an included major release are automatically included.
    
    2. This OEM License only permits redistribution and resale as part of the
       "Fictional Acme Widget Application".
    
    3. The Work covered by this license includes all ImageResizer plugins 
       offered by Imazen LLC which are also available under the terms of the
       Enterprise license.
    4. The Larger Project which includes the Work shall not be sold
       or licensed for a lower price that that part of the Work is available
       for separately from the Licensor.



Unlike the license terms below, content above this sentence is not legally binding, and is only provided for informational purposes.

### 2. Nature of License.

This license is perpetual, and cannot be transferred. 

This license is royalty-free.

This license can be revoked under any of the following conditions

1. If the terms of this License are violated.
2. If the Licensor determines that the intention of the license has been violated.
3. If the Licensor determines that the rights granted in this license have been exercised for harmful purposes.

The Licensor is not required to contact you before revoking your license, nor is the Licensor obliged to provide a refund if your license is revoked. 

If this license is revoked, any sublicenses that have been issued to Clients are also immediately revoked. The Purchaser is held responsible for the collective actions of their Employees and subsidiaries in regard to this license.

Examples of an abuse that may trigger a license revocation:

* Redistributing the Work except as permitted by this License.
* Redistributing modifications that are harmful to users, the community, or the Licensor

To be valid, this license must be accompanied by a Scope Agreement.

A Scope Agreement defines what the Licensed Work is, which versions are included, and whether major or minor upgrades are included.

A Scope Agreement may restrict which products or product types are permitted to include the Licensed Work. 

### 3. Grant of Usage Rights.

You are granted the right to use the Work and any Derivative Works on an unlimited number of physical or virtual machines operated AND either owned, rented, or licensed by  You or the Purchaser. 

You are granted the right to use the Work and any Derivative Works on an unlimited number of hosting accounts or hosting services as long as those accounts and services are paid for by the Purchaser.

You may integrate and/or link to the Work from an unlimited number of projects. 

With the following exclusions:

* Installation for use by other parties. For example, this DOES NOT grant a hosting provider the right to install the software for customer use unless that customer has purchased a license separately.
* It is prohibited to *resell* hosted usage of the software (Software as a Service). SaaS license terms are described in a separate agreement.

### 4. Grant of Modification and Redistribution Rights

You may modify the Work and prepare Derivative Works, subject to the following restrictions:

* You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files.
* You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.
* If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works and any copies of the Work must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.


You may redistribute the Work and Derivative Works to a Client as part of a Larger Work, provided that You meet both the above conditions regarding modifications and the conditions which follow:

* The Work and Derivative Works (but not the Larger Project) shall be licensed to the Client under the terms of the [Professional Client License][proclient], or a license which is compatible with those terms.
* Proof of the transaction between the Client and Purchaser must exist. 

* The Larger Project MUST permit the Work to be upgraded to a new, backwards-compatible revision
* The Larger Project MUST preserve the original extensibility of the Work.

* The Client must purchase a separate license if the Client wishes to change the integration of the Work and the Larger Project, or to integrate the Work with another project.

* You must give any recipients of the Software a copy of the [Professional Client license][proclient] and a copy of the [Apache License Version 2][apache] (which applies to some portions of the Work). You must ensure that those terms are as accessible and prominent as other license files which may accompany the Larger Project. 
* Some portions of the Work may depend upon third-party libraries, and these libraries may in turn require that their license be conveyed to all recipients. For details, consult the COPYRIGHT.txt file associated with each component of the Work which you intend to redistrube.

The restrictions contained within this license shall not prevent you from exercising rights granted by a different license. For example, you may choose to use Apache 2-licensed portions of the work under the terms of the Apache 2 license, and modify and redistribute those portions as permitted by the Apache 2 license agreement. 

### 5. Suggestions for Redistribution of Derivative Works.

It is suggested that changes to the Work and Derivative Works be submitted to the Licensor for code review PRIOR to redistribution. Without code review, the Licensor cannot support modified versions of the Software. In addition, some changes may be acceptable for inclusion in the official version of the Work, reducing your maintenance costs.

It is suggested that a description of the changes made to the Work be included when the Derivative Work is redistributed.


### 6. Sale or publication of Unethical Derivative Works is prohibited. 

An "Unethical Derivative Work" is software, in Object or Source form, which meets all three of the following conditions.

* (i) competes with any of the Licensor's software
* (ii) was released after the Licensor's software it competes with
* (iii) includes any portion of the Work. 

Sale, public distribution, marketing, and publication of Unethical Derivative Works is prohibited. Development and use of Unethical Derivative Works within Your organization is not prohibited by this clause, but may be subject to other restrictions contained in this license agreement due to its inclusion and/or modification of the Work.

Examples of prohibited actions: 

* Publishing, publicly distributing, marketing, or selling software which combines ImageResizer with disk caching functionality, and is marketed as an imaging library.

To clarify, if you are the “first to market”, you do not have to worry about retroactively being in violation of this clause. 

To comply with this clause, prior to publishing your product, simply compare the purpose of your  product 
to the purpose of each of the products offered on <http://imageresizing.net/> and <http://imazen.io>.
If the purpose or marketing of the products is similar, then you should contact 
support@imageresizing.net for written clarification and permission (provided free of charge, if applicable).



### 7. Grant of Patent License.

For the purposes of this section, "Infringed Claims" shall mean all patent claims licensable by the Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to their Infringed Claims.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### 8. Submission of Contributions. 

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, by submitting any Contribution to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work, you grant the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sub-license, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

In addition, unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be implicitly released by You under the terms and conditions of the [Imazen Contributor Agreement](/licenses/contribute) AND (if applicable) the  [Imazen Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement](/licences/contribute-corp), without any additional terms or conditions.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with the Licensor regarding such Contributions.

### 9. Marketing.

By purchasing a license, you automatically opt-in to receiving notices of important version releases, announcements, and security notices. You may opt out of these at any time using the unsubscribe link included in each e-mail.

We also reserve the right to list you as a client or user of the software, and use your logo for promotional purposes, unless you explicitly opt-out via an e-mail to support@imageresizing.net.

### 10. Trademarks.

 This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

### 11. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

### 12. Limitation of Liability. 

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 13. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. 

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
