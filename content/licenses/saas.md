#Imazen SaaS License v1.0

The [OEM][oem] and [SaaS][saas] licenses are included with an [OEM, Silver, or Gold support contract](/support/contracts/compare).  These contracts also include an [Enterprise license][enterprise], which includes certain redistribution rights. The Imazen SaaS License does not grant redistribution rights, as it specifically grants the SaaS usage rights not permitted under the [OEM][oem] and [Enterprise][enterprise] licenses.

This is not the only license available. We offer [enterprise-wide][enterprise], [domain][domain], and [OEM][oem] licenses for [immediate purchase](/licenses). ImageResizer V4 and later may also be used under the terms of the [AGPL 3.0][agpl]. Portions of ImageResizer V4 may be used under the terms of the [Apache License 2.0][apache]. For development and testing, you may use the software under the terms of the [Trial license][trial].

### Summary

This license permits use of ImageResizer plugins as part of a SaaS product. 

All other ImageResizer licenses specifically exclude SaaS usage.

To be valid, this license must be combined with a scope agreement, which may restrict use to a particular service or product, and will specify which plugins and plugin versions are included. 

Design and approval of a scope agreement is completely at our discretion. Please contact [support@imageresizing.net](mailto:support@imageresizing.net) to discuss your specific scope needs *prior* to checkout. 

Examples of scenarios requiring this license:

* Offering a hosted blog or CMS service which uses ImageResizer to process customer assets.
* Offering a real estate or rental listing service.
* Offering a media asset management or image hosting service. 
* Offering a SaaS product in which any customer-provided images are processed by ImageResizer, or in which any ImageResizer-served images are provided over a customer domain.

Conditions under which you do not need this license:

* Access to to all images, and the management (uploading, editing, removal) thereof is provided equally to all non-administrative users, and your service  does not offer any paid services or subscriptions, and does not display third-party advertising.
* You are able to comply with the conditions of the AGPL 3.0, and provide the public with access to the complete source code for your service under [AGPL 3.0][agpl] acceptable terms (which includes MIT and [Apache 2][apache] source licensing).
