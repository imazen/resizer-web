# Resizer Freedom license

In ImageResizer V4, software published under the Resizer Freedom license is instead provided under the more permissive [Apache License 2.0][apache]. 

Nearly all ImageResizer V4 “Essential Edition” plugins offered by Imazen may be used under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. See [LICENSE.md in the project root for details](https://github.com/imazen/resizer/blob/develop/LICENSE.md).

In ImageResizer V3, this license is used by the Resizer Core, the [17+ free plugins](/plugins) in the ImageResizer.Plugins.Basic namespace, and the [Logging plugin](/plugins/logging).

## License summary:

No restrictions, except you can't use my own code to compete with my own products.

Permitted actions

 * Usage
 * Modification
 * Redistribution
 * Sub-licensing (but the original license must be included with the source and binaries)
 * Hosting providers may install as a shared library (in the GAC) on their servers.

An exact copy of the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php), but with one extra condition (in bold).

If you purchased an [Enterprise](/licenses/enterprise) license read those terms instead. If you comply with them, you're automatically complying with this license.

## License Terms

Copyright (c) 2012 Imazen

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
all copies or substantial portions of the Software. 

2. **Sale, public distribution, marketing, and publishing of derivative works 
are not permitted if those works directly and primarily compete with previously published product
offerings of the authors (Imazen LLC).**

**To comply with this clause, compare the purpose of your derived product 
to the purpose of each of the products listed on <http://imageresizing.net/> and <http://imazen.io>.
If the purpose or marketing of the products are similar, then you should contact 
support@imageresizing.net for written clarification and permission (provided free of charge).**

**An example prohibited action would be selling a derived version of the ImageResizer which included a disk caching plugin (since that behavior is provided by an pre-existing plugin).
If you are the 'first to market', however, you do not have to worry about retroactively being in violation of the license.**

**This no-backstabbing clause is included to insure continued maintenance and improvement of the software.**

**This clause does not apply if the author is deceased, or if said products are no longer offered or maintained (reverting to the standard MIT license).**
