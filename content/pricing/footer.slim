        ## Overview
        The ImageResizer v4 core library and [18 plugins in the Essential edition](/plugins/editions/free) are free and open-source under the [Apache 2 license](/licenses/apache).

        Development of ImageResizer is funded by our commerical licences to the Performance and Elite editions. Commercial licenses also include source code and permit modification; most permit redistribution. 

        All Imazen software is open-source, and your funds help (both directly, and indirectly) maintain dozens of critical low-level, permissively-licensed OSS libraries across a wide spectrum. Visit [our GitHub profile](https://github.com/imazen) to see some of the work we maintian. 

        If you are able to comply with the AGPL v3 and provide the public with access to the complete source code for your website/service under any [AGPL v3](/licenses/agpl) acceptable terms (which includes MIT, GPLv3, and [Apache 2](/licenses/apache)), then you may use *all* ImageResizer plugins for free under the terms of the [AGPL v3](/licenses/agpl).

        ## FAQ
        Q: Are licenses perpetual?
        : Enterprise-wide subscription licenses become perpetual (for pre-existing versions) after 3 years. Some subscriptions allow you to purchase perpetual licensing for a additional one-time fee.  Legacy version-specific licenses were perpetual, but had to be re-purchased when new versions were released. We're adopting a more regular release cycle, and have thus retired the old model. 

        Q: Can I buy plugins individually?
        : No.

        Q: Can I upgrade from one license to another? 
        : You can switch between subscriptions in your customer portal. 

        Q: What can I use for free?
        : The [Essential Edition](/plugins/editions/essential). Check /resizer.debug to verify you're not using any paid/AGPL3 plugins.

        Q: Do you have a redistribution/integration guide?
        : [Yes, we do have information on redistributing and integrating ImageResizer](/docs/redist).
