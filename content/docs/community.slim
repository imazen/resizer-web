    .title: h2 Develop and Share

    markdown:

      **All Imazen software is developed on Github, with community collaboration**. **E-mail your GitHub username to `support@imageresizing.net`, and we'll give you access** to the [github.com/imazen/resizer repository](http://github.com/imazen/resizer). We've never denied a request for access, and we happily accept and test any [correctly licensed](/licenses/contribute) pull requests we receive.  To see a [list of other libraries Imazen has created, go to imazen.io](http://www.imazen.io/software).

      If you're new to Git, [we have instructions for installing and connecting to GitHub](/docs/git).

      If you're not sharing code, we suggest [using the NuGet packages instead](/docs/install/nuget) to keep up-to-date, as they're updated frequently. 

    .title: h2 What should I create?
    markdown:
      If you want to make something lots of people will use, [browse the ideas forum](http://resizer.uservoice.com/forums/108373-image-resizer). **Or, create a module that enhances ImageResizer integration with your favorite CMS, WYSIYG editor, or media tool.** 

      Our open plugin model makes it simple to add server-side functionality, and our [rigorously standardized and backwards-compatible URL API](http://riapi.org) (along with [our client-side wrappers](https://github.com/nathanaeljones/studiojs)) make it easy to integrate on the front-end.

      We're always quick to provide assistance to developers creating community plugins, so feel free to reach out and ask questions!

      **Also, check out [the Redistribution and CMS Integration Guide](/docs/redist) if you're interested in redistributing ImageResizer with your product.** We provide priority assistance to other open-source projects using ImageResizer.

    .title: h2 Discuss Ideas
    markdown:
      **[Share your ideas and feature requests on the UserVoice forum](http://resizer.uservoice.com/forums/108373-image-resizer), so others can vote on, comment about, and perhaps implement your proposals**. The ImageResizer project isn't just about resizing. We're Lightroom as a web-service, but with a plugin model so things don't get bloated - and the community is free to innovate.

      If your idea doesn't get enough votes to be developed by Imazen, don't despair - **If you want to take a shot at implementing it, we'll help you out!** We're generally willing to publish community plugins in the /Contrib folder, although you may prefer to host it on your own [GitHub repostiory](http://github.com) so we can add a link to it on this page.

      A strong and diverse community is essential for the health and quality of any software library.
    
    .title: h2 Community Support
    markdown:
      Many ImageResizer users [monitor Stack Overflow for questions tagged *imageresizer*](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/imageresizer), and may answer your question before we can get to it. 

      Please be courteous; vote good answers up, and mark them as accepted. Make sure your questions include a gist with the diagnostics page output, and you've included all relevant details and detailed error messages. It's best to register and select a username instead of posting anonymously; anonymous posts are often considered spam.

      We strongly suggest [reading the support page](/support) before posting, as nearly all common mistakes are explained there.
