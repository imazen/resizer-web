# FFmpeg Plugin


*PLEASE NOTE*
* **This plugin is not forwards-compatible. Avoid usage for maximum compatibility with Imageflow and future major ImageResizer releases.**
* **Do NOT use with untrusted data. This plugin passes source files to ffmpeg.exe, which (like all software with embedded codecs), has a history of vulnerabilities.**
* **Using this plugin with malicious files could result in a remote code execution vulnerability.**
* **We only provide a the version of FFMpeg we used for development. You should locate and use the latest release of ffmpeg for optimal security.**
* You can view [recently reported vulnerabilities here](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=ffmpeg) and [here](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search-results?query=ffmpeg&search_type=all&cves=on)



Dynamically extract frames from videos by time or percentage. Includes basic blank frame avoidance. Wrapper for ffmpeg.

## Installation

1. Add ImageResizer.Plugins.FFmpeg.dll to your project using Visual Studio. 
2. Add `<add name="FFmpeg" downloadNativeDependencies="true" />` inside `<resizer><plugins></plugins></resizer>` in Web.config.
3. During `Application_Start`, call  `ImageResizer.Configuration.Config.Current.Plugins.LoadPlugins()` to ensure that ffmpeg is downloaded before the application starts accepting requests.

## Use

`http://example.com/videos/thisvideo.m4v?ffmpeg.seconds=45.3`

* `ffmpeg.seconds=45.3` - Will grab the frame 45.3 seconds into the video file. Fastest way to grab an image.
* `ffmpeg.percent=50.1` - Will grab the frame 50.1 percent through the video file (slower, as the videos length must be queried)
* `ffmpeg.skipblankframes=true` - Even slower - if the acquired frame is blank, another frame 5 seconds later will be chosen, and so on, up to 4 times.
