ShortVersion: 3.4.1

# Resizer 3.4.1 - October 30 2013

This release fixes a small but troublesome bug in ImageJob. Please read the [3.4.0 release notes for very important guidance and upgrade instructions](/releases/3-4-0).

## Bug fixes in core

* Fix NullReferenceException (for RequestedInfo or ResultInfo) when the ImageJob was created without any constructor parameters. Fixes bug #54.

## Enhancements to RemoteReader

* Requests in base64 encoded form (which lack a signature) can be now validated via whitelisting.


## Known remaining bugs

* AzureReader2 and 404plugin are incompatible
* When using auto-cropping (mode=crop), scale=down may sometimes be ignored, acting as if scale=both was set.
