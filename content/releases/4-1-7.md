# Resizer 4.1.7 - Jun-6-2017

* Makes significant correctness improvements to the FastScaling engine. You may need to adjust your interpolation settings to increase perceptual sharpness. 
* Fixes memory leak in OpenCV (Faces, RedEye) by upgrading OpenCVSharp
* Performance improvements
* Adds performance monitoring (see /resizer.debug)
* Adds support for remote license files and remote reporting of performance and environment/config metrics. If you are using a remote license file, check /resizer.debug to see exactly what will be reported. By using a remote license you agree to have this information logged when your license file is fetched. We will not sell this information; we primarily use it to determine the focus of our development and optimization efforts.
