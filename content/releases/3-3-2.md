# Resizer 3.3.2 -  Jan 24 2013

This release fixes a performance issue in DiskCache, which was preventing 304 Not Modified responses from being returned. The bug was introduced in 3.3.0


## Release notes

Are you using the FreeImage, WebP, Faces, or RedEye plugins with downloadNativeDependencies="true"? Make sure you call `Config.Current.Plugins.LoadPlugins()` from `Application_Start` in `Global.asax.cs` to prevent a rare loading bug.

Not yet fixed: When using auto-cropping (mode=crop), scale=down may sometimes be ignored, acting as if scale=both was set.

## Bug fixes in Core (which affected DiskCache)

* Fixed: IResponseHeaders.LastModified was still being written to HTTP headers, even when it had a value of DateTime.MinValue. Caused by timezone difference.
* Fixed: ClientCache was forcing HTTP last-modified to match the source file. This is incorrect behavior. Together with the previous bug, this was preventing 304-Not-Modified from being returned properly when using DiskCache. Bug was introduced in 3.3.0.
* Fixed: Improved error messages for image decoding issues
