## New plugins

## Fixed bugs

* AzureReader and AzureReader2 now use correct NuGet dependency version ranges
* S3Reader and S3Reader2 now use correct NuGet dependency version ranges

## Known remaining bugs

* AzureReader2 and 404plugin are incompatible
* When using auto-cropping (mode=crop), scale=down may sometimes be ignored, acting as if scale=both was set.
