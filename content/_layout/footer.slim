        h3 About
        markdown:
          ImageResizer is the result of 9 years of continual refinement, with a focus on security, stability, and image quality. Thousands of popular websites rely on ImageResizer; some with millions of pageviews each day, like [Sierra Trading Post, MSN, and eBay](/testimonials).

          It provides far more than image resizing; [with our 40+ plugins](/plugins), it becomes a **comprehensive media-processing suite**.

          Don't doom your site to inevitable instability by [using flawed code from the internet](http://nathanaeljones.com/163/20-image-resizing-pitfalls/). Our core library is compact, free, and well-tested. `Install-Package ImageResizer`.

          Not on Windows? Check out [Imageflow](https://imageflow.io) for a cross-platform solution that doesn't rely on any Windows APIs.
